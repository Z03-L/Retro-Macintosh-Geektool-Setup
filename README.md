# Retro-Macintosh-Geektool-Setup
<img src="screenshot.png" />
<p> A simple Geektool setup based on the original Macintosh's UI. The wallpaper in the screenshot is Apple's "Dusty Rose" wallpaper which you can find in the "Colors" folder of the desktop & screen saver system preferences. </p>

<p> The "chill.jpg" image in the bottom right widget is from here: https://www.hdwallpapers.in/yellow_car_pink_umbrella_and_palm_trees_hd_vaporwave-wallpapers.html </p>

<p> The widget frames are just images that were made in Affinity Designer while using images of the Macintosh's UI as reference. </p>
