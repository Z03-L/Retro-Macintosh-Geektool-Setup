<img src="screenshot3.png" />
<p> A simple Geektool setup based on the original Macintosh's UI. The wallpaper in the first screenshot is Apple's "Dusty Rose" wallpaper which you can find in the "Colors" folder of the desktop & screen saver system preferences. The one in the second screenshot can be found <span> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Harshit-T/Wallpapers/main/walls/there.jpg">here</a></span>. </p>

<p> The widget frames are just images that were made in Affinity Designer while using images of the Macintosh's UI as reference. </p>

# Setup
1. Clone the repo locally.
2. Open GeekTool and place the frames on your desktop as image Geeklets.
3. To set up the greeter widget, place a shell Geeklet and point it to the `time.scpt` file.
4. To set up the Spotify widget, place an image Geeklet and name it "albumArt". Then, place a shell Geeklet and point it to the `spotifyControl.applescript` file.
5. To set up the weather widget, place an image Geeklet and name it "weatherArt". Then, place a shell Geeklet and point it to the `weather.scpt` file.
6. Then, edit the `weather.scpt` file, changing the image URLs in the file to the location of your weather images. (It will be in the "Widget Frames" folder in the cloned repo. Note that spaces in the path must be replaced with `%20`. A trick to getting this right is to open the images in your browser and copy-paste the URLs from there into the `weather.scpt` file.
7. Arrange the widgets how you like.
